# README `/checks`
Contains various `check_mk` checks for DataONE Coordinating Nodes,
Member Nodes, and Operations servers.

## General

Unless otherwise specified, these `check_*` scripts should be placed in
`/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local` and made executable.

Verify operation by executing the sript, then log in to the monitor and
from `Wato`, select the host and "Save & go to Services" to verify the
new checks show up. Choose to activate the new services and save the
configuration.
